      For my project I would like to make a website dedicated to the life of Mac
      Miller. Mac Miller is a popular rap artist that unfortunately passed away
      in 2018. He was only 26 at the time of death, but in his short time here
      he was able to make an incredible impact. He was able to release six
      albums, two eps, two live albums, thirteen mixtapes, forty-four singles.
      One of the pages will be an early life page taking you through the life of
      Mac Miller before fame. This page will include information and photos from
      his early life. Another section will look at all of the official studio
      albums that he released. Looking at some of the popular songs on each
      album and how they impacted his career. Separately we will take a look at
      some of Mac Miller's collaborations and relationships. Mac was able to
      work with some of the biggest artists and built many great relationships
      while in the industry, and there will be another section on this. Overall
      this page would be a website dedicated to the life and work of Mac Miller.
      The website would take a look at his life, accomplishments, and
      impact. The target audience of the website would be fans of Mac Miller
      looking to remember or appreciate his life and work.
