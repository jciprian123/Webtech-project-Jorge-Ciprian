    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>
      Sure, here's a brief biography of Mac Miller: Mac Miller (real name
      Malcolm James McCormick) was an American rapper, singer, and producer born
      on January 19, 1992, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a Jewish
      family and attended Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh, where he
      began to develop his passion for music. Miller began his career in music
      at a young age, releasing his first mixtape "But My Mackin' Ain't Easy"
      under the name EZ Mac at the age of 15. He gained a following on the
      internet and continued to release a series of successful mixtapes,
      including "The High Life" and "K.I.D.S.". In 2011, Miller released his
      debut studio album "Blue Slide Park", which debuted at number one on the
      US Billboard 200 and made him the first independent artist to debut at
      number one on the chart in over a decade. The album was a commercial
      success, but Miller faced criticism from some hip-hop fans who felt that
      he was too pop-oriented. Miller responded to these criticisms with his
      next album, "Watching Movies with the Sound Off" (2013), which showcased a
      darker, more introspective side of his music. The album was a critical
      success and established Miller as a serious artist in the hip-hop scene.
      Over the course of his career, Miller continued to explore different
      styles and genres, incorporating elements of jazz, soul, and R&B into his
      music. He released a number of successful albums and mixtapes, including
      "Faces" (2014), "GO:OD AM" (2015), "The Divine Feminine" (2016), and
      "Swimming" (2018), which was released just a month before his death.
      Miller struggled with drug addiction throughout his life, and his death on
      September 7, 2018, was attributed to an accidental drug overdose. He was
      26 years old at the time of his death and was mourned by fans and fellow
      artists alike. Miller's legacy in the music world continues to be felt
      today, with his introspective lyrics, musical experimentation, and
      commitment to honesty and vulnerability inspiring a new generation of
      artists.
